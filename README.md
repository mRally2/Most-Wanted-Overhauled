   <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <p align="justify">You are in front of possibly the most ambitious mod has ever been made for this game. What happened to be a small and simple hack to disable the brake to drift mechanics turned out as a huge gameplay overhaul!

Having a new handling model based on grip instead provides a way more natural feel to all cars that have been tuned originally by the old Criterion team with care and detail. Each aspect (being RWD, 4WD, FWD, having shorter or larger wheelbase, distance between axis and more) is quite noticeable and has a substantial impact in how the vehicle behaves on the road. It’s hugely recommended to drive without upgrades other than nitrous to notice and appreciate the distict aspects of each vehicle in particular nonetheless, you can experiment with the upgrades as it can provide the vehicle a different feel.

Physics were massively improved over their previous title, Hot Pursuit (2010). Looking at the footage of previous builds you could see them trying to convert the brake to drift model they had into grip but resulted in being harsh and not enjoyable to drive. Many months later into development they updated their physics code making it much more complex which you can now have a glimps of with the changes I made and experience yourself how good it is. Feels and looks as if it was straight out of a more serious racing title.

The majority of changes that have been done to accomplish this grip model are related to the steering component and a few to the handbrake behavior. It’s also worth mentioning the fact they gave each car by default a low steering rate at high speeds for no apparent reason which creates the feeling of having a huge imput lag. This mod solves this issue increasing the steering rate by almost 5 times.

Handbrake has also quite a big part in making this model shine. It has been tuned to trigger shortly the drift component Criterion programmed for smooth transitions and manouvrability through tight corners and also has been set to decrease the speed of the vehicle during powerslides instead of the other way around used for the vanilla drift model. This way gripping and drifting through a corner will not have much difference in speed although there’s still ways to cheat it out as it needs to be fixed and rebalanced in the source code most likely. You also have the choice of using it for a short period of time when cornering while full steering, kind of like a regular brake if you ever need it.

Having this new model in place, you must think twice where to use your nitrous, whether you want to step on slippery surfaces with less than 4 wheels or not, gripping on a low speed corner or drift through it and much more. There’s also this phenomenon where if you have your steering fully locked on one side or the brake pressed when landing a big jump, you will spin out guaranteed. The physics are this complex if you ever thought about it.

Give this a try in multiplayer as well while the servers are still up and running which is unknown for how much longer they will. This grip model can provide a brand new experience which you can enjoy with your friends too. If you didn’t enjoy multiplayer back then this might make you reconsider it.

As a personal opinion, I wish they kept this physics code for much longer than 2 titles. Rivals (2013) was the last game to use it mostly because Criterion was the one starting its development which also brings the fact that with very few changes you can turn its handling model into a grip focused one with quite good results. This is probably the last great physics code NFS will ever have for a long time...

I’d like to point out how good they programmed AI’s behavior. You can see how racers fight each other for the position as well as cops trying their best to stop them while also fighting back to maintain the position in the race. This is truly a rare sight in racing games almost no one could see properly in order to appreciate it. Now thanks to this gameplay overhaul, it’s possible.

Vehicle health has now a huge importance in gameplay making you look after it each pursuit you engage. When having less than 50% of health, a red aura surrounding the car on screen will fade in and out depending on the severity of the damage to indicate you to survive and look for the closest gas station available to repair your ride.

The overall pursuit system have become much harder. This time around the FCPD will escalate their tactics to Hot Pursuit mode and go full force on you no matter the heat level. Good luck keeping your vehicle on the road for as long as possible. Use all your driving skills to shake them off. If you get busted, the pursuit bounty you earned will be subtracted from your total SP balance.

The new career economy it is composed of 2 game modes to achieve the 10 million SP bounty to face the #1 Most Wanted racer and become Fairhaven’s Most Wanted. The first mode consists on winning every race from each car available which in total sums around 4 million SP, whereas the second mode is based in evading the cops in the revamped pursuit system which can eventually add up to the remaining 6 million SP you need for career completion. This mode has had the bounty given for entering each heat level rebalanced. Now, from heat 1 to 6 you will gain the following amount of SP: 2000, 8000, 12000, 18000, 25000 and 35000. Thanks to the existance of multiplayer, this can be extended up to 3 game modes since you can earn a considerable amount of SP there which affects the single player progression as well.

There’s a PostFX filter and Weather effect randomizer included as well. The first randomizes the RGB values from 1.0 to 0.75 in order to provide slight changes in environment colouring while the latter will randomize between having or not the following effects: wet roads, alternative lighting, rainy mood and thunder effect. The last two of these have not been used originally and the alternative lighting is almost impossible to trigger by instancing events since almost no one of those has it enabled.

Lastly, a functional speedbreaker reminiscent of the original Most Wanted title and which was also planned to be released as a regular weapon alongside many others that were cut has been added. Use it wisely at your own free will.

   <p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <ul>
      <li>Controller users will experience steering input to be locked on one side due to unknown reasons. Perhaps is a bug caused by increasing the steering speed/sensitivity or any other parameters I modified myself in order to develop my custom handling (hypothesis)</li>
      <li>Rear wheel drive cars among others can experience snap oversteer when turning. Do not panic and lift off or control the throttle and countersteer to have more chances to save it from a crash</li>
      <li>There’s a very low chance of getting softlocked after the busting process is over if you lose all health by hitting a SWAT van roadblock or some other unexpected chain of events. Start a MW race to get out of it</li>
      <li>Even though the mod has an Autolog SP overwrite solution is highly recommended to play the game while in offline mode from the EA App (Origin) for safety</li>
      <li>You must have to be careful not going on 4 wheels over slippery surfaces such as puddles, grass or dirt. Driving partially over these can cause the car to lose control and spin out with low chances of recovery</li>
      <li>Watch out when powershot boosting out of slow corners driving rear wheel drive cars the most as they will tend to spin out due to the huge and quick increase in torque</li>
      <li>When changing between custom camera presets is recommended to switch vehicle for the new parameters to apply correctly</li>
      <li>Rihno units appearing all of sudden in the front very few meters from your position or racer AI being reset to their previous position many times a second due to the race balancing correcting the rubberband behavior</li>
      <li>The vehicle’s body trembling when full steering into the corner. It might have to do with the spring simulation</li>
      <li>The car making a weird quick turn when using the handbrake at very high speeds. It’s rather intended to be used at lower speeds for quick 90 degree turns, keep it in mind</li>
      <li>The rims twitching even when the car is stopped after being spiked</li>
      <li>Track tires and reinflates not being able to be equipped due to the absurd grip values they are given and breaking the gameplay aspect of being spiked</li>
      <li>Some races might become too easy or too hard depending on your car and upgrades used. Don’t expect to finish first all the time as is not the purpose of this mod</li>
      <li>Cop cars might not have their paint changed if they were part of an opening cutscene</li>
      <li>Because of how Cheat Engine trainers work, if you close its window you will still have all scripts that got enabled in the first place. In order to disable them all, you must do it manually by killing all instances of the trainer in the Task Manager. It is also highly recommended to do this process if the game crashed</li>
   </ul>
